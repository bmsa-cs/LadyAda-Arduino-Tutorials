# LadyAda Arduino Lessons

Updated, Markdown versions of the excellent introductory Arduino tutorials by Limor "LadyAda" Fried at [LadyAda.net](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html).

The original materials are licensed CC BY-SA 2.5, these updated Markdown materials are released under CC BY-SA 4.0. Read `LICENSE.md` for the full text.

## Status

All of the lessons have been copied from the original website, and images are in `images/`. The formatting needs cleaned up for Markdown and some of the screenshots need updated (such as configuring the board and using the Serial Monitor.)
